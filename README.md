# Insurance Hedging Simulator

A quantitative prototype for modeling insurance liabilities, valuing them under interest rate scenarios, and computing risk sensitivities (parallel duration, DV01, and key-rate durations). It mirrors core tasks in **insurance hedging** and **fixed-income risk analytics**.

---

## ✨ Current Capabilities

### Liability Modeling

* **Annuity Certain (Immediate)** — fixed annual payments for $N$ years
* **Deferred Annuity** — fixed annual payments starting after a deferral period
* **Life Annuity (Immediate)** — payments contingent on survival (Gompertz–Makeham)

### Discounting & Curves

* **Flat-rate valuation** (continuous or annual compounding)
* **Zero-curve valuation** via `ZeroCurve` (continuous-compounded zeros with interpolation)

### Risk Analytics

* **Effective Duration (parallel)** — bump-and-reprice under flat or full curve
* **DV01 (parallel)** — PV change per 1 bp parallel move
* **Key-Rate Durations (KRDs)** — tenor-specific duration via local pillar bumps

### Simple Hedging (DV01 Matching)

* **Plain-vanilla 10y interest-rate swap** (annual fixed)
* Size **payer-fixed** notional to offset a **positive** liability DV01
* **Stress tests**: parallel ±100 bp and key-rate +25 bp at 2y/5y/30y

### Scenario Generation (optional module)

* Parametric curve shapes (**flat / upward / inverted**)
* **Vasicek** short-rate paths and derived zero curves

### Engineering Hygiene

* Modern Python package (`src/` layout, `pyproject.toml`, `pytest.ini`)
* Unit tests (monotonicities, parity, scenarios)
* **GitHub Actions** CI (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) runs tests on push/PR

## 📊 Example Outputs

### A) Flat-Rate Demo (`examples/liability_demo.py`)

```text
== Liability demo (annual payments, continuous comp) ==
AnnuityCertain PV @2% : 1,631.97
AnnuityCertain PV @5% : 1,232.90
DeferredAnnuity PV @2%: 1,476.67 (deferral lowers PV)
LifeAnnuity PV @2%    : 1,504.60 (mortality lowers PV)

AnnuityCertain Duration (eff) @2% : 9.84 years
AnnuityCertain DV01 @2%           : 1.61 per 1bp
LifeAnnuity Duration (eff) @2%    : 9.48 years
LifeAnnuity DV01 @2%              : 1.43 per 1bp
```

**Interpretation:**

* **PV falls as rates rise** (2% → 5%): 1,631.97 → 1,232.90.
* **Deferred < Life**: deferral cuts out *guaranteed early payments* (head-end), which sharply reduces PV.
* **Life < Certain**: mortality reduces expected later payments, lowering both PV and duration.
* **DV01 positive**: liability PV falls when rates rise (and rises when rates fall).
* **Consistency check**: $\text{DV01} \approx PV \times \text{Duration} \times 10^{-4}$ holds.

### B) Curve-Based Exposures (`examples/risk_exposures_demo.py`)

```text
AnnuityCertain (curve-based)
PV (base): 1,378.71
Parallel Duration: 9.21  |  DV01: 1.27 per 1bp
Key-Rate Durations (per 1bp):
   0.5y : -0.000
   2.0y : 0.351
   5.0y : 1.317
  30.0y : 1.749

DeferredAnnuity (curve-based)
PV (base): 1,133.23
Parallel Duration: 14.20  |  DV01: 1.61 per 1bp
Key-Rate Durations (per 1bp):
   0.5y : -0.000
   2.0y : -0.000
   5.0y : 0.950
  30.0y : 4.836

LifeAnnuity (curve-based)
PV (base): 1,279.58
Parallel Duration: 8.87  |  DV01: 1.14 per 1bp
Key-Rate Durations (per 1bp):
   0.5y : -0.000
   2.0y : 0.372
   5.0y : 1.367
  30.0y : 1.590
```

**Interpretation (curve):**

* Parallel DV01/duration line up with flat-rate intuition at similar yields.
* Deferred annuity’s KRD mass sits in **long tenors (30y)** → back-loaded cash flows.
* Life annuity is slightly **front-loaded** vs. certain → lower duration and modestly shorter-tenor KRDs.
* Consistency check: $PV \times \text{Duration} \times 10^{-4}$ ≈ DV01 for each line item.

### C) Hedging Demo — DV01-Matched Swap (`examples/hedge_demo.py`)

```text
Base PV (liability): 1,378.71
Parallel DV01 (liability): 1.27 per 1bp

Sized hedge: payer-fixed 10y, notional ~ 1,543.17
Fixed rate locked at par: 3.842%

Stress P&L (currency units):
Parallel +100bp     Liability:   -119.30  Hedge:    124.87  Net:      5.57
Parallel -100bp     Liability:    135.48  Hedge:   -137.14  Net:     -1.66
+25bp @ 2y          Liability:     -1.21  Hedge:      0.72  Net:     -0.49
+25bp @ 5y          Liability:     -4.52  Hedge:      2.68  Net:     -1.84
+25bp @ 30y         Liability:     -5.98  Hedge:      0.00  Net:     -5.98
```

**Why this makes sense**

* DV01 matching knocks down **parallel** risk; residuals are convexity/tenor mismatches.
* A single 10y swap won’t hedge a **30y** key-rate bump; use multiple maturities to target curve shape if needed.

## 🎯 Why This Matters

This project shows you can:

1. Model insurance liabilities,
2. Value them on realistic curves,
3. Quantify **where** rate risk lives (overall and by tenor), and
4. Size a **plain, explainable hedge** that neutralizes first-order exposure—then communicate residual curve risk.
